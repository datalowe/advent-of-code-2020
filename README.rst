Advent of Code 2020 Solutions
==================================
In this project you can find my solutions for the `Advent of Code 2020 <https://adventofcode.com>`_ challenges. Each day's input and solution are in a directory of their own. Remember to try solving the challenges yourself before looking around in this repository, so as to not spoil them.

I used C, which I've hardly used before and am trying to learn more about, for the first few days. I will probably mostly use Python, R and JavaScript.
